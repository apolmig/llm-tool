Test Article 1,"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.","ML is an AI subset enabling systems to learn from experience, developing programs that access and use data autonomously."
Test Article 2,"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change.","Climate change involves long-term temperature and weather shifts, now primarily driven by human activities since the 1800s."
Test Article 3,"Quantum computing harnesses principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally new ways. Unlike classical computers that use bits, quantum computers use qubits which can exist in multiple states simultaneously.","Quantum computing uses quantum mechanics principles, employing qubits that can exist in multiple states unlike classical bits."
